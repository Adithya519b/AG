        <p><b>Happy Birthday, My Love.
            Today, the world became brighter the moment you were born, and one day, fate led me to the most beautiful soul I've ever known—you.
            I may not be your husband yet, but my heart is already yours for a lifetime.
            Thank you for being the light in my life, the calm in my chaos, and the dream I never want to wake up from.
            I can't wait to celebrate every birthday with you, side by side, as partners, lovers, and best friends.
            Here's to your day, your smile, and the future we're building together.
            I love you—today, tomorrow, and always.</b></p>
